Note: My final project write-up has a total of 4 pages taken up by tables and figures in terms of space, despite occupying a span of 5-6 pages. The analysis and findings make that 4 pages seem longer (just for grading purposesâ€”-I followed directions!). Additionally, there is no data folder in this repository because I got each data set into R by code using URLs.

Project Title:
Investigating California's COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts by Region and County


Brief Description:
This project investigates how California is handling COVID-19 vaccines by region 
and/or county, focusing on questions related to: (1) percent of fully vaccinated 
individuals by county/region, (2) how increases in cases/deaths potentially
influence vaccine uptake, (3) how vaccine companies differ in share of the 
market, (4) how vaccination efforts differ by age group, and (5) how vaccination 
efforts differ by race and ethnicity.
